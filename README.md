# ue4-keyboard-template
A template for custom keyboard caps for WASD Keyboards for UE4 shortcuts

UE4-WASD-Layout.svg is a vector template made in Inkskape conforming to [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com) requirements for a full custom key cap set.

Bad photograph of how the results turned out. In this picture, my 'long keys' are not installed. I am waiting for more rail stabilizer pegs to come in since my pegs seemed to be glued into my existing DAS Keyboard keys. I like how it turned out, but I'd probably recommend others to go a little lighter for the blue color I used if printing on black keys.
